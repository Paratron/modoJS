#modoJS
modoJS is a component-based javascript user interface library, offered under the MIT license.

It enables you to create modular user interfaces quickly by combining pre-created UI widgets
that are ready for the most use cases. If special user interface components are missing from the
library, you can simply add them to it via an easy API.

## HEADS UP!
V2 changes everything, since its not Backbone and jQuery based anymore but works with the ReactJS
framework.

V2 is still in alpha stage and has nearly no documentation. I strongly advise against using it currently.
